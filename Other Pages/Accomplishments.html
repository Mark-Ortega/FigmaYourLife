  <p>In my journey so far, Me and my party haven't accomplished much, though our journey has just begun. Although we haven't had much of a chance to earn glory, we have had small victories such as making it through one of the most dangerous roads in town, even though my party thought it was safe to stop and help passerbyers getting duped into a confrontation. We are currently in some sort of town and managed to find some work that can potentially pay some gold if we don't screw it up. Other then that, my greatest achievment is managing to purchase a silk robe from the local goods store. Not much but as a monk I usually put my proceeds into the temple so getting some new clothes was a nice little victory for me</p>
